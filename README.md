# ece523clinicalpatientnotes
Final Project for ECE 523

The purpose of this project is to interpret notes that doctors leave for patients and categorize them, such as if there is a note that says, "no longer plays tennis", it can be categorized as "loss of interest in activities". We will need to identify clinical concepts in generic patient notes. The competition deadline is May 3, 2022. We will be using the provided dataset from Kaggle to complete this project, GitHub for version control, and we will write the final paper on Overleaf.
